## Live Face Mask Detection 

The code includes a face mask detection system built with TensorFlow and OpenCV. It begins by loading images from a dataset and processing them. The MobileNet model is then used for transfer learning, with the prepared dataset being compiled and trained.Following training, the script evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and loss. It displays these metrics using Matplotlib graphs. It also includes features for predicting whether faces in images are wearing masks or not, using Haar cascades for face detection.The system also handles errors and serialises data using pickle to ensure model persistence. The script shows how to load the model and run predictions on new images. Finally, it plots precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, and loss trends across epochs to evaluate model performance and training dynamics.
